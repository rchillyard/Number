  * Rules for matching:
  * (1) All substitution is based on a successful match -- no match, no substitution;
  * CONSIDER this second rules seems strange
  * (2) The first match to try for any expression is the exactMaterializer which returns Match(Literal(value));
  * (2) Some matches return non-exact match results -- these should be passed to flatMap simplifier;
  * NOTE: do not pass anything to flatMap simplifier if it could possibly be the same as the input (else stack overflow).
