= Number: A Scala Mathematical Library =

Number is a comprehensive Scala 3 library providing exact and fuzzy arithmetic with sophisticated type hierarchies and lazy evaluation.

== Modules ==

The library is organized into five modules:

 - [[com.phasmidsoftware.number.core `core`]]: Core type hierarchy including `Number`, `Eager`, `Structure`, and basic arithmetic operations
 - [[com.phasmidsoftware.number.algebra `algebra`]]: Algebraic types including `WholeNumber`, `RationalNumber`, `Real`, `Angle`, `Complex`
 - [[com.phasmidsoftware.number.expression `expression`]]: Expression types for lazy evaluation and symbolic computation
 - [[com.phasmidsoftware.number.parse `parse`]]: LaTeX expression parsing using FastParse
 - [[com.phasmidsoftware.number.top `top`]]: Top-level convenience APIs and string interpolators

== Key Concepts ==

=== Exact vs Fuzzy Arithmetic ===
The library supports both exact computations (for rational and algebraic numbers) and probabilistic fuzzy numbers with uncertainty propagation.

=== Normalization vs Materialization ===
 - `normalize`: Symbolic simplification to canonical form, may change type to most appropriate representation
 - `materialize`: Numeric evaluation to approximate values

=== Equality ===
 - `===`: Exact equality (using Cats Eq typeclass)
 - `~=`: Fuzzy equality based on probabilistic overlap of uncertainty distributions

== Getting Started ==

{{{
import com.phasmidsoftware.number._

// Using string interpolators for LaTeX expressions
val expr = math"2 + 3 * x"

// Exact arithmetic with rationals
val rational = Rational(22, 7)

// Fuzzy arithmetic with uncertainty
val fuzzy = Number.create(3.14159, 0.00001)
}}}

== Integration ==

The library integrates with the Cats ecosystem for typeclass-based abstractions and uses FastParse for parsing LaTeX mathematical expressions with KaTeX rendering support.
